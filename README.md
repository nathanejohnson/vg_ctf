vg_ctf
======

automated solution for http://www.vg.no/ctf/


This requires [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/), which in turn requires [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).  This includes a copy of the md5 js library at [http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5](http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5).

Run it like so:

    git clone https://github.com/nathanejohnson/vg_ctf.git
    cd vg_ctf
    chmod 755 ./vg_ctf.js
    ./vg_ctf.js [yournickname]

The nickname is optional, but it is what you will see on the leader board (assuming you make top 10).

If you want to link to a github, enter the nick like so:

github:youraccountname
